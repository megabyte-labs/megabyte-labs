      <Heading level={3}>California Online Privacy Protection Act</Heading>
      <Paragraph>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
      policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
      (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
      consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
        those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See <a class="underline-hover" href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConsumerCal.org's article on CalOPPA</a>.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <b>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</b>
      </Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found in the side navigation menu.</li>
        <li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy page.</li>
        <li>You can change your personal information by logging in to your account and managing your settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <Heading level={3}>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</Heading>
      <Paragraph>We don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
      browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because for security reasons we collect IP addresses to prevent
        malicious attacks. Malicious attackers are blocked from impacting our sites algorithm.</Paragraph>
      <Heading level={3}>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</Heading>
      <Paragraph>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.</Paragraph>
      <Heading level={3}>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</Heading>
      <Paragraph>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's
      Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
      protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must
        do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</li>
        <li>We do not collect age data so third-parties are responsible for limiting the collection of PII from children under 13.</li>
      </ul>
      <Heading level={3}>Fair Information Practices</Heading>
      <Paragraph>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
      they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
      the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data
      breach occur:
      </Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</li>
        <li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.</li>
      </ul>
      <Paragraph>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
      enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
      not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
        courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</Paragraph>
      <Heading level={3}>CAN SPAM Act</Heading>
      <Paragraph>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages,
        gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>We collect your email address in order to:</Paragraph>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <Paragraph>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
        <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
      </ul>
