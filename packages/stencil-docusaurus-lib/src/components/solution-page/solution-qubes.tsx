            What is Qubes OS?
          </Heading>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Qubes OS is a security-focused, open-source operating system that is designed to provide better security and isolation for its users. Unlike traditional operating systems, Qubes OS uses a unique approach to security called "Security by Compartmentalization."
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            This approach involves separating different applications and tasks into isolated compartments, called "qubes," which are each assigned a specific level of trust. For example, you can have a qube for your personal documents, a qube for browsing the web, and a qube for running sensitive applications. This way, if one qube is compromised, the others remain secure and unaffected.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Qubes OS also provides other security features, such as strict isolation of networking and USB devices, enforced memory management, and compartmentalized cryptography. It is designed to be used on a variety of hardware, including laptops and desktops, and supports a range of applications, including web browsing, email, office productivity, and multimedia.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Qubes OS is free and open-source, which means that anyone can access the source code and contribute to its development. It is often used by journalists, activists, and security professionals who require a high level of security and privacy in their work.
